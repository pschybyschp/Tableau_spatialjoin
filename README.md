# Tableau_spatialjoin
Data sets for spatial join with Tableau

The geojson data set are free and available here:
Traffic counter facilities: https://daten.berlin.de/datensaetze/standorte-der-verkehrsdetektion-berlin

Districts: https://daten.odis-berlin.de/

Load the data in Tableau and create a spatial join to answer following question:
How many traffic count facilities are located at a bus lane (‘Busspur’) in district ‘Tiergarten Süd’?

Have fun with Tableau and Spatial Data!
